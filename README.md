# nudger

Project Nudger is our solution to task management in shared living spaces. The goal of this app is to make delegating shared tasks to the people living together easy and argument-free.
The app allows people to be assigned to groups representing shared living spaces, and from there chores can be automatically assigned to the people in a particular group.

In the future, a weight system for the chores would be implemented to assess the relative difficulty of choers and balance the load between each person.
